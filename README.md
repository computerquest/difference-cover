# difference-cover

Difference Cover Search (DCS) is a novel algorithm for difference cover search, a combinatorial search problem, that reduces the number of combinations checked by over 99%. I am currently drafting an undergraduate publication that goes into depth explaining the algorithm and its reasoning. When it is complete, I will add it to this page. 

I would like to thank Professor Ankur Gupta for his contributions throughout this project.
